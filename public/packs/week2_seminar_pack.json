      "model_answer": "Explain  how each  of the following  leads  economists  to believe  that demand  falls for a\nparticular good as its price rises (that demand is downward sloping):\n- Diminishing  marginal  utility\n- The income  effect\n- The substitution  effect\n Diminishing marginal utility suggests that as an individual consumes more of a good, the\nutility (pleasure)  that each additional unit  of consumption brings falls. Correspondingly, the\nprice she  is willing  to pay for each  additional  unit falls, which  therefore  leads  to a downward\nsloping  demand curve: higher quantities of demand can only be achieved through lower\nprices.\nThe income effect states that demand is downward sloping because as the price of a good\nincreases,  the lower  the income  I have  relative  to that price,  and therefore  the less I am\nlikely  to demand of the higher priced good. The income of individuals is really a relative\nconcept – the absolute  amount  of your money  is worthless  to you, it is what  it can buy\nwhich  is of significance, and what your money can buy is determined by the price of the\ngoods you want to buy.\nTherefore, as the price of a good rises, your income relatively falls and therefore if you\nwant to maintain  your consumption  of that good  you can buy fewer  other  goods:  your likely\nresponse  to demand less of the higher priced item.\nThe substitution  effect  states  that as the price  of one good  rises  relative  to another  good  of\nsimilar design, the  more  we are likely to demand  the second  good, and  therefore  the less\nwe will demand the good for which the price has risen. This could work in two ways: first,\nyou may demand the more expensive of two goods, but as the price rises of this the\ncheaper version becomes more attractive; or, you may demand the cheaper good, but if\nthe price of the cheaper good rises, the extra quality of the more expensive good becomes\nmore attractive: it is the relative price which  is moving which is the most important part\nhere.",

An increase  in the desirability  of the good\n This is a personal question asking you to reflect upon your own demand preferences. I think for\nme, a common  example  of the first option  would  be (most)  foods  whereby  the more  I eat the less\nI really want anymore. This is not always the case though – some food products can be quite\naddictive  for which  the diminishing  marginal  returns  does  not seem  to be present  (at least  over\nlow levels of consumption).\nAn example of the second product could be an addictive good – the more you consume the more\nyou want  to consume  more.  A more  mundane  example  for me might  be something  like electricity.\nI guess I consume quite a lot, but I do not experience diminishing marginal returns. One of the\nreasons for this would be because we use electricity in many different ways. I have diminishing\nmarginal utility in watching television, but if I was getting bored of this maybe I would go online –\nboth use electricity, but the way I am consuming it is very different (sort of).",

What  are the problems  with trying  to infer a demand  curve  over different\ntime periods?  This is a question designed to make you think a little more deeply about the assumptions commonly\nmade  and taken  for granted  in economics.  Types  of discussions  points  could  include:\n• A ‘Veblen good’  where an increase in prices leads to an increase in the quantity demanded.\nTypically  these  are thought  to be the case for status  goods  where  owning  it informs observers\nthat you can afford it.\n• Psychological  pricing.  Typically  goods  are priced  in round  numbers  and/or  with  the ending ‘99p’.\nThe concept behind this is that ‘£x.99’ seems cheaper than ‘£(x+1).00’. This would imply  that the\ndemand function is  not smooth but  exhibits big  jumps  when  moving across these psychological\nbarriers.\n• Other  causes  for discontinuity  in the demand  function  (that  is, not smooth).  For example if two\ngoods are very close substitutes, demand for one may be zero if the price goes above a certain\npoint.\n• A normal  good  is one which  as incomes  fall the quantity  demanded  decreases.  This in\nprinciple desc ribes most goods. A possible example is food.\n• An inferior  good  is one which  when  incomes  fall demand  increases.  A typical  example  is\nfood purchased from certain low budget supermarkets (e.g. Aldi).\n• A Veblen  good  is one where  as prices  rise the quantity  demanded  rises.  Typical  examples\ninclude status products as discussed above.\nii. Independent  of these  problems,  what  can we intuitively  state  about  the\nstrength  of the relationship between prices and demand in the higher\neducation market in England?\niii. Is there  an intuitive  argument  for why higher  education  may be a Veblen  good?\n There is a lot of economic research into the benefit of a university degree. Studies frequently\nshow that individuals with degrees will earn more over their lifetime than those individuals\nwithout, but why this happens is disputed. One prominent theory suggests that all a degree\nprovides is a signal to potential employers that highlights that an individual with a higher\neducation qualification is better than one without. Under this theory were prices to increase the\nsignal  would  become  more  exclusive  and therefore  be worth  more.  This in theory  could  lead  to an\nupward sloping demand curve both for higher education in general but also for individual\ninstitutions.  The problem arises from the fact that it is very hard to appeal to the ‘ceteris paribus’ assumption\nthat all other  things  are equal.  Over  the course  of a year  many  other  changes have  occurred  other\nthan a change in prices and as such it is hard (and possibly impossible) to isolate the relationship\nbetween prices and demand.\nDemand  for higher  education  in England  does  not seem  to be sensitive  to movements  in prices.\nDespite the increase in prices over the time period there has also been an increase in demand\n(although at lower rates than would have been anticipated at the old prices).",
